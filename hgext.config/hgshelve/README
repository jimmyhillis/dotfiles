OVERVIEW

The shelve extension provides the shelve command to let you choose which parts
of the changes in a working directory you'd like to set aside temporarily, at
the granularity of patch hunks. You can later restore the shelved patch hunks
using the unshelve command.

The shelve extension has been adapted from Mercurial's RecordExtension.

See `hg shelve --help` for the complete list of commands.

DEVELOPER INFO

Like Mercurial, hgshelve comes with regression test suite to verify its core
functionality as changes are being makde. To run this test, you need the
mercurial source package, and execute hgshelve's test suite via the Mercurial's
run_test.py:

    $ cd your-hgshelve-repo
    $ /path/to/hg-repo/tests/run_test.py *.t
